# DSg_BH2y

CVAE architecture is used
Same Functions and python files in resources are used
**CVAE_example.py** contains model
**CVAE_functions.py** contains loss, plot and other functions used
 
### Platform used: Kaggle, Colab

### Hyperparameter tuning
Hyperparameter tuning process is done manually by comparing values in case of different hyperparameter
This process is shown in **notebook_hypertuning_process.ipynb**

After that final hyperparameters is implemented in **notebook_final_(for_result).ipynb**

### Result
Final result is saved in ./bh2y_final resorces/result
